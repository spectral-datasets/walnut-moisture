Spectra of walnut kernel for moisture content measurement.

The rapid and accurate detection of moisture content is of great significance to the quality evaluation and 
oil extraction process of walnut kernel. Near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy is an ideal method for measuring 
moisture content in walnut kernel. In this paper, an analysis model for the moisture content in walnut kernel 
was developed based on NIR diffuse reflectance spectroscopy using chemometric methods. The different spectral 
pretreatment methods were adopted to pre-process the original spectral data. The whole spectra band was divided 
into 5 subbands, 10 subbands, 15 subbands and 20 subbands to screen specific wavelengths relevant to the walnut 
kernel moisture content and different pretreatment spectral data. The PLS, MLR, PCR and SVR were used to 
establish the relationship model between the spectral data and measurement values of moisture content. In 
comparison, the optimized modeling conditions were determined as follows: detection wavelength range from 1349 
to 1490nm, SNV+1st preprocessing, and PLS modeling. Under these conditions, the square correlation coefficient(R2) 
and root mean square error of prediction(RMSEP) of the prediction model were 0.9865 and 0.0017, respectively. 
The results of this study provided a feasible method for the rapid detection of moisture content in walnut 
kernel. In addition, in order to improve the the performance and applicability of the model, it was necessary to 
continuously expand the size of the sample set.
